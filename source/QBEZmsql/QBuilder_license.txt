Question:
"I created a modified version of the Open Query Builder to compile in Lazarus. It&#039;s working perfectly, with all the resources in Windows and Linux GTK2 and QT. I created also an enginer to connect with a suite of components ZEOS.

Download: http://github.com/jepafi/Laz_Query_Builder/archive/master.zip

I wonder if you have any objections to what I did? And what you allow me to do with the modified code? Can I use the code converted to Lazarus in commercial software?
